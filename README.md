# 🌻 ***CoNetRes*** the independent *Community Network Resource Mapping* toolkit
*Community Network Resource Mapping* software it's a toolkit that provides a big picture of the **supply**, **support**, and **aid** **capacity and needs** of a community, to support effective and efficient **collaboration** inside and between communities.

## ⭐ Features
Using *CoNetRes* anyone can share and request any kind of resources in a secure way within their communities and/or make publicly available.

- Data collection with [*Sociocybernetic methods*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/constructivist-approach#B9780080970868321407-s0035)
- Highly customizable queries
- Secure profiles (Anonymous by default) with [decentralized identity and access management](https://iop-stack.iop.rocks/dids-and-claims/specification/#/dac)
- [Progressive Web Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application) on all digital platforms, with offline mode and push notifications
- Create Multiple personas
- Create Multiple communities
- [P2P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_peer-to-peer_processes) communication on secure channels

`✌ cross-platform document-oriented database editor with higly customizable predefined templates`

### The toolkit
&hellip; can be used to build [progressive web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application) for resource mapping, on most of the digital platforms, and using gateways in special needs (SMS, Nat, IoT).

### The data
- is collected using [sociocybernetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocybernetics) techniques,
- stored in MongoDB using [decentralized identity and access management ](https://iop-stack.iop.rocks/dids-and-claims/specification/#/dac) with GDPR compliant privacy and data security,
- aggregated through APIs (in relevant cases) and open protocols like [Murmurations](https://murmurations.network/);
- the data collection and actualization is incentivized using *ThankYou points*,
- validated by the community with the help of embedded *personal value formula variable* (advanced reputation system)
- processed with [data anonymization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_anonymization) using decentralized IDs (DIDs).
- The data owner (User/Community) fully controls the stored data and accessibility.

### Authentication
&hellip; can happen through
- the main contact channels (email, phone, social),
- OAuth as secure delegated access,
- cryptographic hash function with mnemonic

### Use case

## 🔥 Story

I came up with this idea when I realized:
> The globally **failing *economic*, *political* and *social institutions*** induce bottom-up collaborations, because fixing our problems from above **does not provide lasting solutions** to our needs anymore.

We need secure tools and effective methods for **efficient allocation of resources**, because today independent communities lack technology to *collect*, *process*, and *share* their available resources, as well as the resources in need.

We started to develop an open-source **resource mapping solution** done in an *independent* and *collaborative* way, with *anonymous data collection* and *secure information management*, which are key roles today! We are developing a **highly customizable open-source toolkit** for this.

In a *collaborative society* all *independent communities* need to have any resources to **do their best** and be able to communicate **without boundaries** in a secure way.

### Example A
Local farmers can map and share their available machinery and ask for unused organic materials, then others farmers doesn't need to buy and maintain those expensive tools and can give back materials to increase fertility. In the same time a small gardener will know where to go for a good compost and where to send her kids to learn about growing food.

## 🛠️ Development
*CoResNet* is an **open-source toolkit** for *independent communities* to be able **to articulate the needs and share available resources** in a secure and trustworthy way.

> We are open for any kind of support to have this software available to any community around the world!

[JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Rust, Golang coders, holochain specialists, data scientists and Machine Learning experts are needed to team up! - Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/i2we20-community-network-resource-mapping-toolkit-dev/joins/pXX5uQfIV87UWdQpEjHzXA)

1. We are using [HackMD](https://hackmd.io) to clarify the bigger picture and to collaborate on all related information.
2. Using social interactions and google forms we undertook research across different communities.
3. The technical background for the development is provided by other open-source solutions, like [ßoiler](https://github.com/LaKing/boilerplate "is a modular framework for Javascript-based projects, mainly web applications") Javascript framework with [codepad](https://github.com/LaKing/codepad "Browser-based collaborative development environment"), the collaborative development environment running on [srvctl](https://github.com/LaKing/srvctl "Systemd based server and containerfarm manager").
4. The main language is `JavaScript` with `node.js` and `Vue.js`, using `JSON`, `HTML5`, `CSS`.
5. Source code is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/eapo/CoNetRes/)

> The toolkit can't be monetized, crowdsourcing, donations, and even business can be built on it with a pro-rata share to gain money, development, and necessary resources.

### For the MVP
The next steps for the MVP of the *Community Network Resource Mapping* toolkit are 
1. to have a fully customizable form for data collection, [0--(40)--100]
2. list available COVID-19 and pandemic solutions as resources and possible deficiencies,
3. be able to have anonymous profiles with customizable details and P2P contact information [0--(20)--100]

#### Good to have
4. multiple views with filters to display the collected data, such as
    - an egocentric zone view, where resources can be listed in related zones, like categories [0]
    - a dependency map, where missing resources can be revealed easily [0]
    - a geolocation view, where resources can be located providing easy access to them [0]

### To reach these steps
- good open-source programmers are needed,
- stable motivation/incentive is needed (funds, events, perks, etc)
- the continuous presence of mentors are needed mostly in the fields of `#Data_science` `#Psychology&Sociology` `#UIUX_design`
